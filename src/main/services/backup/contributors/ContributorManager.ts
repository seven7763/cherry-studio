// ContributorManager — non-lifecycle named singleton (registry.md §"ContributorManager
// non-lifecycle singleton + 惰性 finalize").
//
// Deliberately NOT a BaseService: it owns no long-lived resource, holds no DB
// connection, registers no IPC/timer/event side effects — it only performs a
// one-shot in-memory finalize producing a frozen registry. That matches the
// CLAUDE.md "Non-Lifecycle Services" decision guide, so it is NOT in
// serviceRegistry.ts and uses no @Injectable/@ServicePhase decorators.
//
// Lazy trigger: BackupService (a WhenReady lifecycle service) calls
// getRegistry() in onInit(); the first call runs finalize synchronously and
// caches the frozen result. A finalize failure throws ContributorFinalizeError,
// which surfaces as a BackupService.onInit failure → the lifecycle container
// refuses to start, preserving the startup-time validation semantics.
