# Contributor Implementation Spec Summary (PR Reviewer / Contributor Quick Read)

> This document is synthesized from `docs/references/backup/backup-architecture.md` (§2/§3.5/§5.4/§6/§6.2/§7/§8.5). **Purpose**: let reviewers / contributors quickly understand how the contributor system lands (placement + lifecycle + aggregate boundary + invariants + identity propagation + D-model restore execution).

---

## 1. Overview: What the contributor system is

Backup devolves "which domain owns which user-data tables, references, aggregate boundaries, and restore strategies" from a centralized rule store (`DomainRegistry`/`DomainStripper`/`DomainImporter`/`FileCollector`, v1 throwaway) to each business domain, which declares one `BackupContributor`.

**BackupContributor = schema + backupPolicy + operations, three separated layers**:

| Layer | What goes in | What does NOT go in |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` (Entity facts) | table ownership, reference facts, primary-key shape, aggregate boundary, file-ref source, JSON soft reference | SET_NULL/DELETE_ROW actions, import ordering, restore strategy |
| `backupPolicy` | omitted reference override, unique-key merge, field-level FIELD_MERGE (4-strategy enum: `remote-fills-local-null` / `remote-fills-local-empty` / `deep-merge` / `local-priority`), `platformSpecificKeys` | database I/O, file operations, async hooks |
| `operations` (optional) | file resource discovery, beforeArchive, per-row transform, afterImport (in detached `work.sqlite`, D model), blob restore, cloneAggregate | facts and policies expressible as pure data |

- A contributor is a **frozen constant object** (not a class): `export const TOPICS_CONTRIBUTOR = deepFreeze<BackupContributor>({ domain, schema, backupPolicy, operations })`. Rationale: pure data + stateless pure-function hooks; `schema-only` domains naturally support `operations: undefined`; `deepFreeze` guarantees immutability after finalize (any mutation throws TypeError in strict mode).
- **The core mechanism is `schema.aggregates` (aggregate boundary AggregateBoundary)**: it elevates the object-boundary SKIP/OVERWRITE/RENAME from prose descriptions to a **statically verifiable** mechanism—one topic together with its message tree, one Agent session together with its messages, is either imported as a whole or skipped as a whole.

## 2. Placement: Where contributor declarations live

> Addresses PR #12659 review A3: avoid concentrating domain facts into the backup module.

**Rule**: each domain's contributor declaration is **co-located at the actual location of that domain's owning module** (respecting existing main-process directory boundaries, not forcing `src/main/services/`), and the business domain owner maintains that domain's entity facts (table ownership / references / aggregates / file-ref / JSON soft references).

- Path: co-locate at the actual location of the domain's owning module. **per-domain subdirectory** (`<owning>/<domain>/backupContributor.ts`) is the default; a **flat owning module** (multiple domain Services sharing one directory) SHALL use a per-domain subdirectory (`<dir>/<domain>/backupContributor.ts`) or a unique filename (`<dir>/backupContributor-<domain>.ts`) to avoid multiple domains contending for the same path.
- **Actual convention**: data declarations (table/column/reference/aggregate facts) belong to the data layer; each contributor is placed **flat at `src/main/data/services/backupContributor-<domain>.ts`** (avoiding backup → business-module reverse coupling). Two real exceptions: ① `src/main/data/backupContributor-preferences.ts` (PREFERENCES lifted to the parent of `data/`); ② `src/main/services/translate/backupContributor.ts` (TRANSLATE_HISTORY co-located with its business module).
- Location examples (`features/` / `ai/` etc. are **non-binding** co-location illustrations; data declarations still follow the rule above into the data layer): `src/main/data/services/backupContributor-topics.ts` (topics), `backupContributor-providers.ts` (providers), `backupContributor-knowledge.ts` (knowledge), `backupContributor-agents.ts` (AI/agent). Each domain may split into multiple files (e.g. KNOWLEDGE restoreResources is heavy IO and may live in an independent file); tests are placed nearby in that domain's `__tests__/`.
- **The backup module only holds**: the unified barrel (`contributors/index.ts` aggregating the 14 domain exports) + `ContributorManager` + registry + orchestrator. **Pure types / context types / deepFreeze / dbSchemaRefs / BackupDomain / ConflictStrategy belong to the neutral layer** (`@main/data/db/backup/`, see below); backup and each domain's contributor depend on it in the same direction. **It carries no domain-specific table/column/aggregate facts**—otherwise domain facts regress into being concentrated in the backup module, contradicting the devolution goal.
- Check: `src/main/services/backup/contributors/` **SHALL contain only** the barrel (index.ts) / finalize (ContributorManager); **SHALL NOT contain** the orchestrator (lives as sibling modules under `src/main/services/backup/`, e.g. `ExportOrchestrator.ts` — not a required `orchestrator/` subdirectory) / pure types / context types / deepFreeze (belong in the neutral layer `@main/data/db/backup/`) / domain schema/policy/operations declarations.

**Ownership boundary + neutral layer**: pure types / context types / runtime helpers / codegen artifacts / enums consumed by contributors belong to the **process-local neutral layer** `@main/data/db/backup/` (data/schema-owned, main-only): `contributorTypes` (BackupContributor/EntityGraphSchema + hook context interfaces), `contexts` (BackupScopedDb / BackupReadonlyDb only), `freeze` (deepFreeze), `dbSchemaRefs` (codegen DB_TABLES/COLUMNS/PK/FK/FTS + branded types), `domains` (BackupDomain/ConflictStrategy, main-only—the renderer passes simple parameters converted by BackupService and does not import the enums). Business domains (topics/agents/...) + backup service import this neutral layer **in the same direction** to declare and export contributors—avoiding a data-domain contributor → services/backup reverse dependency, and keeping the shared layer from growing (dbSchemaRefs / main-only enums do not go into shared). **SHALL NOT** redefine the `DbTableName`/`DbColumnName` branded types (import from `@main/data/db/backup/dbSchemaRefs`).

> `domain/` (the centralized rule store) is v1 throwaway: contributors are implemented in parallel, and once equivalence tests pass the orchestrator's import source is switched over and `domain/` is deleted—do not fix its bugs, do not add fallbacks.

## 3. Lifecycle: How ContributorManager starts up

> Addresses PR #12659 review A3 (lifecycle placement).

**ContributorManager = non-lifecycle named-export singleton**, aligning with CLAUDE.md "Non-Lifecycle Services Decision Guide":

- Export: `export const contributorManager = new ContributorManager()`.
- Does **not** `extends BaseService`, does **not** apply `@Injectable`/`@ServicePhase`, is **not** registered in `serviceRegistry.ts`, has **no** `@DependsOn`.
- Rationale: it holds no long-lived resources, **does not connect to DB**, has no IPC/timer/event subscription—only the pure-functional behavior of "one-time finalize at startup producing a frozen BackupRegistry".

**Lazy finalize**: `getRegistry()` triggers synchronous finalize + deep freeze + cache (idempotent) on first call. On failure it throws `ContributorFinalizeError` (containing domain/table/owner/violated invariant).

**Trigger timing**: `BackupService` (a WhenReady lifecycle service) calls `contributorManager.getRegistry()` in `onInit()` to lazily trigger finalize—via a direct `import { contributorManager }` (**not** `application.get`, since it is not in the lifecycle container). Failure → `BackupService.onInit` fails → the lifecycle container refuses to start and reports. This preserves the startup-time validation semantics, equivalent to the original `WhenReady + @DependsOn` approach, but without promoting the pure static finalizer to a lifecycle service.

**finalize does not connect to DB**: it only reads codegen artifacts (`dbSchemaRefs.ts`) + contributor declarations, and does not call `application.get('DbService')`. Actual DB table coverage is gated by **coverage tests (CI)**—finalize validates consistency among declarations, coverage tests validate actual schema table coverage; the two are complementary.

**BackupService remains a lifecycle service** (holding long-lived resources such as orchestrator / write-quiesce orchestration / restore journal writing + relaunch trigger—D model, see §5a and backup-architecture §9; the preboot promotion gate is a pure function exported by the db module and does not go through BackupService): `@Injectable('BackupService') + @ServicePhase(Phase.WhenReady)`. It does **not** `@DependsOn(['DbService'])` (DbService is BeforeReady, and phase ordering auto-enforces startup before WhenReady; CLAUDE.md hard constraint: WhenReady services must not `@DependsOn` BeforeReady services).

> **Restore safety (D model, aligned with @0xfullex #16714)**: restore uses **detached merge into `work.sqlite` + preboot atomic promotion**—**never touches the live DB in-process** (see backup-architecture §9). At runtime BackupService only orchestrates write quiesce (bounded; JobManager + AI streams + Channel + drain in-flight renderer writes, owned by those modules + orchestrated by BackupService) + `createSnapshot(work.sqlite)` merge base + detached import pipeline + journal writing + `application.relaunch()`; the preboot promotion gate (`src/main/main.ts` `startApp()` first, after `initPathRegistry()` and before `runV2MigrationGate()`, in a separate sibling `restorePromotionGate.ts`) consumes a narrow journal contract to perform atomic rename promotion + undo (renamed-aside `live.pre-restore-<restoreId>`). Contributors are not responsible for whole-DB snapshot or promotion. **Deprecated (unnecessary under D model)**: RESTORE BARRIER runtime silence (allowlist + `@WriteSilenceable` + renderer mutation gate) / `restoreDbFromSnapshot` (no runtime caller—no runtime rollback; pre-relaunch failure only deletes temp) / `verifyLiveDb` (offline self-run in the work copy + post-promotion check inside the gate) / onInit recovery gate (superseded by preboot) / `PreferenceService.reloadFromDb` + rebroadcast / `armWriteGate` / `armMutationGate` / `rearmSchedulesAfterImport` / `afterCommit` hook (cache is naturally fresh-loaded after the restore relaunch; no live writer during apply—PREFERENCES cache is fresh-loaded by `PreferenceService.onInit`, AGENTS timers are re-armed by `JobManager` startup recovery).

> Check: `serviceRegistry.ts` **SHALL NOT** contain `ContributorManager`.

## 4. Aggregate boundary + 26 invariants key points

### 4.1 AggregateBoundary (§6.2 derivation formula)

`AggregateBoundary { root, renamable, [identityKey?], [identityClass?], [conflictDefault?], [members?] }`—besides `root` and `renamable`, all other fields are **derived by default from `references + primaryKeys`**; a contributor declares them explicitly only when deviating from the default (explicit overrides must also be self-consistent with the derivation; invariant 14 rejects drift).

| Field | Default derivation | When to declare explicitly |
|------|----------|----------|
| `root` | — (hand-written, domain fact: which table is the "object" semantic root) | required |
| `renamable` | — (hand-written, domain fact: whether it can be safely cloned) | required |
| `identityKey` | `primaryKeys[root].columns`; **when root has a UNIQUE constraint (non-PK), it must include the UNIQUE key** (prevents cross-device same-value-different-UUID colliding with SQLite UNIQUE, e.g. `agent_workspace.path`/`tag.name`/`note(rootPath,path)`/`pin(entityType,entityId)`/`agent_global_skill.folderName`/`job_schedule(type,name)`) | PK is composite and the UNIQUE key is not entirely PK |
| `identityClass` | `primaryKeys[root].kind`: `uuid-v4`/`uuid-v7`→`uuid-entity`, `natural`/`composite`→`natural-key`; root has a UNIQUE constraint (non-PK) → `natural-key` | `slot` (predefined slot, codegen cannot infer) |
| `conflictDefault` | `uuid-entity`→`SKIP`; `natural-key`/`slot`→`FIELD_MERGE` | when deviating from default (in production only preference/note deviate to SKIP, a settings-class exception, requiring reason + invariant 21) |

> **FIELD_MERGE field-level merge strategy**: `fieldMergePolicies.strategy` takes one of **4 enum values** (BackupContributorPolicy derived from backup-architecture §6 policy):
> - `remote-fills-local-null` — fill remote value when local is null;
> - `remote-fills-local-empty` — fill remote only when local is null / empty array / default skeleton (prevents seeded placeholders from swallowing backup credentials);
> - `deep-merge` — deep-merge object fields;
> - `local-priority` — local non-empty wins.
>
> **Typical**: PROVIDERS `user_provider.apiKeys` / `authConfig` use `remote-fills-local-empty`—a seeded provider ships with `apiKeys=[]` and a non-empty `authConfig` skeleton; `remote-fills-local-null` would treat them as "already present" and silently drop the backup credentials, while `remote-fills-local-empty` treats `[]` / null / empty-skeleton auth as missing, preserving locally usable keys and pulling in keys only held by the backup (§6 "prevent API-key loss").

| `members` | source tables of in-domain owning include references pointing to the root (`viaColumn`=ref.column, `parent`=ref target, in topological order); junction tables, cross-domain refs, and in-domain owning refs pointing to other aggregate roots are **not counted** | when default members need to be excluded (e.g. self-ref self-reference) |

`AggregateMember { table, viaColumn, cascade:'include'|'optional' }`: include = processed with root as a whole; optional = only set null when root conflicts. Derivation is performed by `finalize` at startup, **not** during hook invocation.

### 4.2 26 invariants key points (refined from §8.5, not a verbatim copy)

Each failure throws `ContributorFinalizeError(invariantId, payload)`, with payload containing domain/table/sourceType/owner fields.

**Ownership and exhaustiveness**:
- #1 each domain has exactly one contributor (`registry.length===14` strict equality: `PREFERENCES/PROVIDERS/PROMPTS/MCP_SERVERS/TAGS_GROUPS/ASSISTANTS/AGENTS/SKILLS/MINIAPPS/TOPICS/KNOWLEDGE/TRANSLATE_HISTORY/PAINTINGS/FILE_STORAGE`).
- #2 each Drizzle user-data table has exactly one owner or is excluded with a reason; #3 no table is owned by multiple contributors; #4/#5 ALWAYS_STRIP/INFRASTRUCTURE/exclusion-set runtime tables are not owned by contributors (`job_schedule` is not excluded wholesale; `type='agent.task'` row-scope is assigned to AGENTS).

**Reference and PK facts**:
- #6 the source table (`ref.table`) of a references entry belongs to the declaring owner; the target may be cross-domain; #7 `omittedReferenceOverrides` binds a declared reference + is non-redundant + has a reason.
- #8 each owned table has exactly one primary-key fact and the columns exist in codegen; #9 the PK kind is not ambiguous; #22 the PK kind is not autoincrement (zero autoincrement PK across the entire database is the foundational prerequisite for having no id remap).
- #10 the references-derived dependency graph has no cycle (Kahn topological sort; a cycle throws `CircularReferenceError`); #23 shared-table row-scope coverage is exhaustive + unmatched fail-loud (prevents dirty type values from silently dropping data).

**Soft reference coverage**:
- #11 every `FileRefSourceType` has an owner or a runtime-only exclusion; #12 declared `jsonSoftReferences` columns actually exist and are of json type (no reverse full-database scan).

**Aggregate boundary (core)**:
- #13 aggregate.root is under the owner; identityKey is its PK or a business UNIQUE key (prevents cross-device same-value-different-UUID colliding with UNIQUE); a non-PK natural-key/slot identityKey must be confirmed by codegen `DB_UNIQUE_KEYS` to actually have a UNIQUE constraint; a PK-backed identityKey (uuid/natural/composite PK) is exempt.
- #14 aggregate.members is derived from owning include references—junction tables, cross-domain refs, and in-domain owning refs pointing to **other aggregate roots** are not counted (only owning refs pointing to this root enter members); optional self-references are not counted; multiple owning references pointing to a member/root must declare an explicit parent, otherwise rejected as ambiguous; a parent chain with a cycle is rejected.
- #15 in members, each member table belongs to this contributor, and viaColumn is a real FK column pointing to root.identityKey or to the parent member's PK (multi-layer cascade A→B→C, C.viaColumn→B, §4.1 parent derivation); junction tables are not counted.
- #16 a renamable:true aggregate must have `operations.cloneAggregate`.
- #26 a renamable:true aggregate's root PK must be single-column (the importer's newRootKey is a single value; cloneAggregate only replaces one PK column; a composite-PK renamable would cause rename identity corruption—change to renamable:false instead).

**FK self-consistency (requires codegen-generated `DB_FOREIGN_KEYS`)**:
- #19 each `EntityReference.kind` is self-consistent with the generated FK onDelete (cascade/restrict → owning or junction; set null/no action → optional; set default → reject).
- #20 a junction/co-owned FK is not declared optional; a NOT NULL column cannot SET_NULL.
- #24 declared EntityReferences correspond to generated FKs; #25 the reverse—**every DB FK must be declared by the owner contributor** (prevents undeclared cross-domain FKs such as `agent.model→user_model` from causing topological missing dependency edges, omitted actions not triggering, and dangling FK rows).

**Freeze and conflict default**: #17 schema is deep-frozen; #18 failure info contains locating fields; #21 a natural-key/slot aggregate's conflictDefault is not SKIP (the settings-class preference/note exception allows SKIP, including `platformSpecificKeys` to exclude cross-platform incompatible keys). The `deviation` payload subclass of #21 also covers `platformSpecificKeys` scope validation (only PREFERENCES may declare it + glob syntax legality) and `polymorphicEntityMap` routing-value validation (value must be a known BackupDomain or `excluded`)—the three share the #21 id and are distinguished by the `deviation` field.

## 5. identity propagation (§5.4)

**Scenario**: an owning/required FK points to a **natural-key aggregate** (target merged via identityKey FIELD_MERGE, local UUID wins). The backup target's UUID is merged away by FIELD_MERGE; the importer **must** build a `{backup target id → local canonical id}` mapping and, when importing the source, rewrite that FK to the local id—otherwise the owning FK dangles (`defer_foreign_keys` COMMIT fails, or the source is lost).

**The rewrite boundary is determined by whether the ref is required (not by whether it is JSON)**:

- **required ref** (target missing → functionality broken)—**must rewrite** when target is merged: ① DB owning FK (`agent_session.workspaceId → agent_workspace`, cross-device same path different uuid); ② **required JSON ref** (AGENTS: `agent_channel.workspace.workspaceId` / `job_schedule(type='agent.task').jobInputTemplate.workspace.workspaceId`, both `AgentSessionWorkspaceSource`), the latter marked as required class via `jsonSoftReferences` and participating in identity propagation—otherwise restore appears successful (`foreign_key_check` passes) but the channel/scheduled task references a dangling workspace.
- **tolerant ref** (`message.data.fileEntryId` attachment soft ref, `chat_message_file_ref` / `painting_file_ref`)—**not rewritten** when target is merged/missing; missing only degrades to a Toast + orphan detection.
- **optional ref** (e.g. `translate_history.sourceLanguage → translate_language`)—rewrite to preserve association, or SET_NULL per optional semantics (cannot leave a dangling backup uuid).
- **junction ref** (e.g. `entity_tag.tagId → tag`)—cascade-pruned with root; the FK is rewritten together when target is merged.

> **Scalar ID column (no FK declaration) three-way classification** (prevents the "no FK = dangling" misjudgment + prevents the "pointing to user data must declare an EntityReference" over-broad reading):
> - Points to a **non-DB resource** (app-builtin preset/constant/directory, e.g. `knowledge.fileProcessorId`, `userModel.presetModelId`/`userProvider.presetProviderId`/`miniApp.presetMiniAppId`) → naturally not an EntityReference candidate (no target table row); not declared, not rewritten.
> - Points to **DB user data + has FK** → declare an `EntityReference` and go through identity propagation (invariants #24/#25 require declared EntityReferences to correspond to generated FKs).
> - Points to **DB user data + no FK** (scalar soft ref, e.g. `topic.activeNodeId`→message, `painting.providerId/modelId`) → **do not declare an EntityReference** (no FK; invariant #24 requires a declaration to correspond to an FK); such cases are handled by `cloneAggregate` rewrite (renamable aggregate, e.g. `activeNodeId` rewritten via the clone mapping to the new message id) or as a tolerant ref (missing only degrades, e.g. painting soft ref). Domains that accept dangling must note the reason in the domain spec (e.g. PAINTINGS).
> "No FK declaration" ≠ dangling risk—classified three-way by "whether the target is a DB resource + whether it has an FK".

> **≠ removed ID remap**: remap generates a new uuid for a uuid-entity source record's PK (not needed; preserve source PK is idempotent); identity propagation redirects the source FK to the natural-key target's canonical id (the source record's PK is unchanged—required by natural-key merge).

**Typical workflow (AGENTS)**: `agent_session.workspaceId → independent agent_workspace aggregate` (an intra-domain cross-aggregate owning reference: same AGENTS domain, but two separate independent aggregate roots). workspaceId is a cascade NOT NULL owning FK, but the target `agent_workspace` (natural-key `path` UNIQUE) is an independent aggregate root, not `session.root`—so invariant 14 does not count it into `session.members`, and the workspace is not forced to be a member. This is not equal to evading owning validation: invariant 25 forces AGENTS to declare this FK → invariant 19 validates that onDelete=cascade corresponds to kind=owning self-consistency (codegen `DB_FOREIGN_KEYS` as data source). `agent_session` renamable:false (cross-aggregate owning clone contradiction + collides with `path` UNIQUE).

## 5a. Restore execution model + hook boundary (D model, aligned with @0xfullex #16714)

> See backup-architecture §9. Contributors are responsible only for **static facts and merge semantics**; the restore execution model (detached merge + preboot promotion) is carried by the orchestrator + db module gate.

### Execution model: never touch the live DB in-process

Restore uses the **D model** (detached merge + preboot promotion)—at runtime it merges on a detached `work.sqlite` copy, and at preboot it performs an atomic rename promotion. This **structurally eliminates** the entire class of half-restored / WAL sidecar replay / runtime rollback risks.

**Runtime (UI-blocking, orchestrated by BackupService)**:
1. **Manifest version gate** (read-only archive inspection, **does not touch the live DB**): format validation + schema comparison (`schemaMigrationId` ordered by `when`(folderMillis)), deciding migrate-forward / direct import / reject. Migrate-forward runs drizzle `migrate` against `backup.sqlite` on a **separate better-sqlite3 connection** (not the live `DbService.sqlite`).
2. **write quiesce** (bounded, a strict subset of the old RESTORE BARRIER): pause three autonomous main-side DB writers — JobManager (cron / GC / overdue) + in-flight AI streams / agent turns + inbound channel messages **+ drain in-flight renderer-originated writes** (DataApi mutation / `Preference_Set` IPC — writes dispatched before the barrier must drain first, otherwise they land on the old live after the snapshot and get overwritten at promotion). **No** renderer mutation gate / Preference/DataApi write gate ("no gate" refers only to gates on **new** writes; restore startup **globally blocks all renderer windows** (WindowManager, not a single-window modal), which itself blocks new writes; cache is naturally fresh-loaded after the restore relaunch; no live writer during apply). The quiesce interfaces for the three autonomous writers are owned by their respective modules; renderer in-flight drain + global window blocking is orchestrated by BackupService (acquiring a write-quiet barrier).
3. **`createSnapshot(work.sqlite)`** — VACUUM INTO, serving as the **merge base** (= a copy of the current live, including `app_state` / `migration_v2_status`).
4. **Detached import** (separate better-sqlite3, not the live `DbService.sqlite`): run the contributor import pipeline against work.sqlite (parameterized handle, detached drizzle; merge semantics SKIP / FIELD_MERGE / only-add preserved) + **FTS rebuild** (importer responsibility, in work.sqlite) + **offline verification** (integrity_check + foreign_key_check + domain checks + FTS consistency). A work.sqlite that fails verification is never promoted.
5. **Restore journal** (userData sidecar file) write + per-step write-ahead fsync + `application.relaunch()` (dev mode does not relaunch → prompt for manual restart).

**Preboot promotion gate** (`src/main/main.ts` `startApp()` first; after `application.initPathRegistry()`, before `await runV2MigrationGate()`; **separate sibling `restorePromotionGate.ts`**; a pure function exported by the db module, consuming a narrow journal contract, with no knowledge of backup semantics): validate `state=='staged'` ∧ **fingerprint** matches ∧ **chainTip** ∈ app bundled chain → checkpoint(TRUNCATE) + close old live → delete stale -wal/-shm (sidecar hygiene) → rename live → `live.pre-restore-<restoreId>` (**undo snapshot, zero-copy**) → rename work → live → **file resources promotion** (in visibility order) → open + integrity_check → journal terminal. **The gate never throws** (transient failure → boot old live + report, never leaves the app unbootable).

**Journal contract** (synced with @0xfullex #16714, 2026-07-04): gate condition = **state machine + fingerprint + chainTip** (drop nonce / appVersion / TTL).
- **state machine**: `staged → promoting → completed/failed/expired` (write-ahead fsync; recovery looks at filesystem reality and idempotently rolls forward / back, never blindly replaying = one-shot, hence nonce dropped).
- **fingerprint** = sha256 of the main DB file, post `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`, asserting `busy==0 && checkpointed==log` (under WAL, mtime / size / header counter do not update; checkpoint-hash is the only zero-false-match; symmetric on both sides).
- **chainTip** = work.sqlite last applied migration `{ folderMillis, hash }`; the gate promotes only when the app bundled migrations chain **contains** this tip (replaces appVersion equality—drizzle `migrate()` is a silent no-op for ahead-of-chain; version equality would false-reject patch upgrades sharing the chain).
- journal location = a **sidecar file** inside userData (not boot-config: global + debounced, no fsync; not `app_state`: the arbiter cannot live inside the DB being arbitrated, and an aside rename would carry it away). restore report + undo bookkeeping go into **`app_state` inside work.sqlite itself** (atomic promotion; same pattern as `migration_v2_status` / seed journal).

**Undo**: journal { promote: `live.pre-restore-<restoreId>` } + relaunch → same gate path (renamed-aside old live = undo snapshot, zero-copy). Undo is the primary value (merge is irreversible → undo = whole-DB revert). retention window + GC + consecutive-restore behavior have numbers TBD.

**importer invariant**: merge preserves `app_state` rows (`migration_v2_status` — already in the backup exclusion set; archive never touches it). work.sqlite = `createSnapshot`(live copy) carries `app_state`; after promotion the migration gate reads `migration_v2_status=completed` and skips — structurally it cannot re-run the v1 import against the restored DB. Avoid a naive `DELETE + re-insert` on `app_state`.

### File resources by visibility (key: not all are additive)

| Resource | Visibility | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| File blobs (`Data/Files/{uuid}`) | DB-gated (`file_entry` rows) | **additive-first** safe (unreferenced blob invisible, orphan sweep can reclaim) |
| KB `{baseId}/` dirs | DB-gated, but orphanSweep skips directories (`if (!isFile()) continue`, only scans `Data/Files`) | additive OK, but an abandoned restore leaks the whole dir forever → **journal-driven cleanup** |
| Notes markdown | **not DB-gated** (notes tree scans `feature.notes.path`, user may point at any folder; the `note` table only stores starred / expanded) | additive **wrong** (after interruption .md are all visible, double-pollution on retry) → **directory-level near-atomic swap**: rename notesPath aside → move restored tree → adjacent DB rename; undo reverses |

- **Sequence**: DB-gated additive → DB rename → Notes dir-swap + destructive overwrites (old renamed aside, undo required) → terminal. Undo reverses.
- **orphanSweep interaction**: `runFileSweep` checks for a non-terminal restore journal and skips (after blob promote, before DB rename, promoted blobs are old-live orphans; the mtime > 5min gate would pass over staging-preserved mtimes).

### Restore-period hook boundary (in-tx vs post-tx strict separation)

Restore-period hooks split into two phases—**in detached work.sqlite, before commit** vs **(D model has no post-tx)**, with a strict boundary (per §9 "detached write-tx fn does only DB ops" constraint — transaction over the detached `work.sqlite` handle, **not** live `DbService.withWriteTx`):

- **`afterImport` (in detached work.sqlite, before commit)**: executed **inside** the detached write transaction, **before** commit; only derived operations depending on rows already written into work.sqlite are allowed—primarily **FTS rebuild** (TOPICS calls `rebuildMessageFts`, AGENTS calls `rebuildSessionMessageFts`, reusing in-tx imported rows and rebuilding the FTS5 content table so it commits consistently with the business rows in the same transaction). This is an importer responsibility, done offline in work.sqlite, not live.
  - > **target-state (C-import pending)**: the detached `afterImport` above is the D-model target state. Neutral-layer types live in `src/main/data/db/backup/contributorTypes.ts` (`AfterImportContext` / `RestoreResourceContext`; `contexts.ts` only holds `BackupScopedDb` / `BackupReadonlyDb`). JSDoc on those interfaces already documents D-model semantics (`backupDb` = work write scope, `liveDb` = read-only view of the same work copy; `liveFileRoot` = journal path only). Field renames and wiring the detached handles belong to C-import (awaiting upstream `createSnapshot` / `applyMigrations` / preboot gate); this phase's contributors only declare the operations policy.
- **(D model has no `afterCommit`)**: the live DB is never written in-process, and the detached work.sqlite holds no runtime cache; the old post-tx responsibilities (PREFERENCES cache reload / AGENTS `job_schedule` timer re-arm) are completed naturally by the **relaunch** after preboot promotion—PREFERENCES cache is fresh-loaded by `PreferenceService.onInit`, AGENTS timers are re-armed by `JobManager` startup recovery. Hence `reloadFromDb` / `rearmSchedulesAfterImport` / the `afterCommit` hook are no longer needed.

> **Merge semantics unchanged**: SKIP / FIELD_MERGE / aggregate conflict / identity propagation (§5) are all preserved; only the import target changes from live to detached work.sqlite. `pre-snapshot` is retained as the `createSnapshot(work.sqlite)` merge base; the crash-safety of the journal state machine is retained as the preboot promotion gate's write-ahead + idempotent roll forward/back. The FTS importer rebuilds offline in work.sqlite (in-tx consistent).

## 6. Per-domain key decisions (§3.5, 14 domains)

`identityClass` / default `conflictDefault` are finalize-derived values; explicit declaration is only for deviating from the default.

| Domain | Aggregate root (+ include members) | identityClass | renamable | Default conflictDefault | lite |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PREFERENCES | `preference[scope,key]` / `note` (`(rootPath,path)` UNIQUE) | natural-key | false | SKIP / SKIP (**settings-class exception**: local-first + backfill; `platformSpecificKeys` excludes cross-platform incompatible keys) | ✓ |
| PROVIDERS | `user_provider` + `user_model`(providerId) | natural-key | false (derived key) | FIELD_MERGE | ✓ |
| PROMPTS | `prompt` | uuid-entity | false | SKIP | ✓ |

> lite preset: 10 domains included, 4 domains (KNOWLEDGE/TRANSLATE_HISTORY/PAINTINGS/FILE_STORAGE) excluded, `includeFiles=false`/`restoreFiles=false`. Junction tables (`agent_channel_task`/`agent_skill`) are not counted as aggregate members; they go through an independent junction reference.

## 7. Contributor declaration example (TOPICS)

Aggregate root `topic` + member `message(topicId)`; on conflict → the whole group (topic + its message tree) is processed by strategy.

```typescript
import { table } from '@main/data/db/backup/dbSchemaRefs'
import { type BackupContributor } from '@main/data/db/backup/contributorTypes'
import { deepFreeze } from '@main/data/db/backup/freeze'

// TOPICS owns topic(uuid-v4) + message(uuid-v7) two tables
// message.topicId→topic.id: in-domain cascade FK → owning include member
// message.modelId→user_model.id: cross-domain set null FK → optional ref (referencedDomain=PROVIDERS)
// message.parentId→message.id: self-reference set null → optional (self), not counted as aggregate member
export const TOPICS_CONTRIBUTOR = deepFreeze<BackupContributor>({
  domain: 'TOPICS',
  schema: {
    tables: [table('topic'), table('message')],
    references: [
      // owning include ref → member
      // optional cross-domain / self refs
    ],
    primaryKeys: [/* topic: uuid-v4, message: uuid-v7 */],
    aggregates: [{
      root: 'topic',
      renamable: true,
      // identityKey / identityClass / conflictDefault / members derived by default from references+primaryKeys
      // members default = [message (viaColumn=topicId, include)]
    }],
    fileRefSourcePolicies: [
      // chat_message_file_ref → ownerDomain=TOPICS; painting_file_ref → PAINTINGS
      // (post-#16532 split: the old polymorphic file_ref table was split by source origin domain into explicit FK tables)
    ],
    jsonSoftReferences: [
      // message.data contains fileEntryId soft reference → tolerant
    ]
  },
  backupPolicy: { /* omittedReferenceOverrides / uniqueMergeRules / fieldMergePolicies */ },
  operations: {
    // renamable:true so cloneAggregate must be implemented
    // cloneAggregate must rewrite the topic.activeNodeId scalar soft ref to the new aggregate's message id
  }
})
```

> TOPICS `renamable:true`: when RENAME-cloning a topic, `activeNodeId` (a scalar text soft ref pointing to message, no FK) **must** be rewritten by `cloneAggregate` (mapped to the new topic's corresponding message id), otherwise the restored topic points to the old aggregate's node / dangling reference—listed as this domain's `cloneAggregate` required rewrite rule.
